        <h1>Nonsense Newspapers</h1>

        <p>
          We present an artistic project employing a StyleGAN2 pipeline to generate gibberish newspapers and analyze their inferred structure. This project aims to produce falsified newspaper images which invoke feelings of simultaneous familiarity and foreignness, and to subvert and call into question the traditions and norms of print design upon downstream analysis of disentangled features in the resulting latent space.
